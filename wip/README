other ideas:
1. start a recording to memory and use ffmpeg linux command to open it and stream it with ncat to the network to avoid having to deal with python and sockets staying alive

  use splitter_port in start_recoprding and stop_recording as mentioned here... default splitter port is 1 so no need to mention it for recording normal files.
